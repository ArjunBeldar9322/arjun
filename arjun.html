      <h2>The Reasoning of Arjuna</h2>
      <p>
        On the battlefield of Kurukshetra, Arjuna, the warrior prince, faces a moral dilemma. Torn between his duty as a warrior and his compassion for his relatives, teachers, and friends on the opposing side, he lowers his bow, questioning the purpose of war and the meaning of righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        His reasoning is rooted in a deep ethical and philosophical conflict: Should he perform his duty (dharma) or follow his emotions? This question sets the stage for the divine discourse of the Bhagavad Gita by Lord Krishna.
